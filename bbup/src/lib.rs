// I'm leaving this file here because I'm sure that I will need some shared
// module in the future and I won't remember that this file has to be called
// lib.rs, nor that I have to import the module with use bbup::<module>

// // To use a common module both in bbup and bbup-server, add the module here
// // and then call it from where you need it with `use bbup::<module>`
// // Let's say you have a module called ciao in the file
// // <root>/bbup/src/ciao.rs. Then add the following to this file. To use the
// // module ciao in bbup or bbup-server, add there `use bbup::ciao`
// pub use ciao;
